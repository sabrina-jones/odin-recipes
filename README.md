# Odin Recipes

This is a basic recipe website built with HTML as part of The Odin Project.

The website includes a main index page that links to individual recipe pages. Each recipe page contains a title, an image, a description, a list of ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.

By completing this project, I practiced writing HTML, structuring a multi-page website, and using elements like headings, lists, images, and links.
